# GraphQL+

Defining a successor to GraphQL

## Intent

Whilst GraphQL is basically sufficient at it's core there are a few limitations and issues that I wish to address.

- The [Schema](graphql-plus/Schema.md) and [Operation](graphql-plus/Operation.md) languages are too intertwined.
- No Generic types
- No Dictionary / Map core type
- No input Union types
- The introspection model is flawed with respect to Nullable and List type modifiers
